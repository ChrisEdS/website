# PHP

Easypanel uses Cloud Native Buildpacks to build Docker images. Thus, you don't have to write and maintain fragile `Dockerfile` files.

For a PHP app, all you need is a `composer.json` file at the root of your project.

## Building the app

In the build phase, the buildpack will install your dependencies using the following command.

```bash
composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader --no-interaction
```

## Running the app

To specify how the app should start, you need to create a `Procfile` file at the root of your project with the following contents.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="apache" label="Apache" default>

```plain title="Procfile"
web: heroku-php-apache2 public/
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nginx" label="Nginx">

```plain title="Procfile"
web: heroku-php-nginx public/
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="built-in" label="Built-in Server">

```plain title="Procfile"
web: php -S 0.0.0.0:$PORT -t public/
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution
Make sure you replace `public/` with your root folder.

## Specifying a PHP version

Inside your `composer.json`, you can specify the PHP version like this

```json title="composer.json"
"require": {
  "php": "8.0.*"
}
```

## Installing PHP extensions

Inside your `composer.json`, you can specify the PHP extensions your project needs.

```json title="composer.json"
"require": {
  "ext-intl": "*",
  "ext-openssl": "*",
}
```

You can find a list of available extensions [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/php-support#available-built-in-extensions).

## Customizing PHP settings

There are multiple ways to change PHP settings. The easiest one is to use [`ini_set`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ini-set) in your PHP code at runtime.

## Private dependencies

If your application uses private dependencies which require authentication, you should configure the `COMPOSER_AUTH` environment variable. The value of this environment variable is JSON with the same structure as `auth.json`. Read more about it [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/authentication-for-private-packages.md#authentication-using-the-composer-auth-environment-variable).
