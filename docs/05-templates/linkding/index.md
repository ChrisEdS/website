1-Click installation template for linkding on Easypanel

## Description

linkding is a self-hosted bookmark manager that is designed to be minimal, fast, and easy to set up using Docker. It provides a clean UI optimized for readability and allows users to organize bookmarks with tags, add notes using Markdown, and use read-it-later functionality. Users can also share bookmarks with other users, perform bulk editing, and automatically create snapshots of bookmarked websites on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. linkding supports importing and exporting bookmarks in Netscape HTML format and provides extensions for Firefox and Chrome, as well as a bookmarklet. It also offers a REST API for developing third-party apps and an admin panel for user self-service and raw data access. linkding can be installed using Docker or Docker Compose, and it supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL databases. Managed hosting options are available for users who prefer a more convenient solution. The application is open source and built using the Django web framework.
