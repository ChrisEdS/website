## Description

Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool designed to make organizing events and meetings easier. It allows users to create meeting polls to find a time that works for everyone. The app is free to use and does not require login. It is mobile-friendly and provides notifications for participants. Users can also comment on polls. Rallly is open-source and self-hostable, giving users full control of their data. The app is ad-free and user-funded. It is created by Luke Vella and is available on GitHub.
