# Heimdall

1-Click installation template for Heimdall on Easypanel

## Description

Heimdall Application Dashboard is a dashboard for all your web applications. It allows you to add links to any web application or website. It is designed to be simple and elegant, with a visually pleasing interface. Heimdall is backed by the linuxserver.io group and has a strong support system. It supports three types of apps: Generic apps, Foundation apps, and Enhanced apps. Installation is easy, with options for Docker or manual installation.

## Benefits

- Simplicity: Heimdall is designed to be simple and easy to use. It avoids the trap of introducing too many options and features, making it complicated for users.
- Elegance: Heimdall has a visually pleasing interface, with a focus on design. It aims to encourage users to use the app and discover its benefits.
- Support: Heimdall is backed by the linuxserver.io group, which provides strong support. They have contributed to over 150 million Docker pulls.

## Features

- Generic Apps: Heimdall allows you to add links to any web application or website, even if it's not intrinsically supported. You can customize the name, background color, and icon.
- Foundation Apps: Heimdall supports a list of foundation apps, where you can simply start typing the app name and it will show up in a dropdown. It fills in the default background color and icon for you.
- Enhanced Apps: Enhanced apps in Heimdall allow you to use an app's API to display extra information automatically. You just need to enter the API credentials.
- Installation: Heimdall can be installed using Docker, which is the easiest way. There are also manual installation instructions available for Ubuntu.
