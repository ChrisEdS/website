1-Click installation template for Keycloak on Easypanel

## Description

Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution that provides authentication, authorization, and user management for applications and services. It allows you to add authentication to your applications with minimum effort, eliminating the need to store and authenticate users. Keycloak supports single sign-on, enabling users to authenticate once and access multiple applications without having to log in again. It also supports identity brokering, allowing users to log in with social networks or existing identity providers. Keycloak provides centralized management through an admin console, where administrators can configure identity brokering, user federation, and fine-grained authorization policies. Users can manage their own accounts through the account management console, where they can update their profile, change passwords, and set up two-factor authentication. Keycloak is based on standard protocols such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML, and it offers high performance, scalability, and customization options through themes and extensions.

## Benefits

- Single Sign-On: Users authenticate with Keycloak once and can access multiple applications without having to log in again.
- Identity Brokering and Social Login: Keycloak supports login with social networks and existing identity providers, making it easy to integrate with external authentication systems.
- User Federation: Keycloak can connect to existing LDAP or Active Directory servers, or you can implement your own user provider.
- Centralized Management: Administrators can manage all aspects of the Keycloak server through the admin console, including identity brokering, user federation, and fine-grained authorization.
- Standard Protocols: Keycloak is based on standard protocols such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of applications and services.
