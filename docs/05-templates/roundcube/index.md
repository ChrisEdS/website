1-Click installation template for Roundcube on Easypanel

## Description

This project is a free and open source webmail solution with a desktop-like user interface which is easy to install/configure and that runs on a standard LAMPP server. The skins use the latest web standards to render a functional and customizable UI. Roundcube includes other sophisticated open-source libraries such as PEAR, an IMAP library derived from IlohaMail, the TinyMCE rich text editor, Googiespell library for spell checking and the HTML5-PHP sanitizer by Masterminds.

## Instructions

After Roundcube is installed, you can log in to the mail accounts on the service where you entered the &quot;SMTP&quot; information.
