# Verdaccio

1-Click installation template for Verdaccio on Easypanel

## Description

Verdaccio is a lightweight private npm proxy registry built in Node.js. It provides a compatible API with npm clients and supports semantic versioning. Verdaccio is a web app based on Node.js that acts as a private npm registry and a local network proxy. It is easy to install and use, and offers Docker and Kubernetes support. It is 100% compatible with yarn, npm, and pnpm.

## Benefits

- Use private packages: Verdaccio allows you to use private packages in your company without sending the code to the public. You can use your private packages just as easily as public ones.
- Link multiple registries: If you use multiple registries in your organization and need to fetch packages from multiple sources in one project, you can chain multiple registries and fetch from a single endpoint.
- Cache npmjs.org registry: Verdaccio can cache the npmjs.org registry, reducing latency and providing limited failover if you have multiple servers from which you want to install packages.
- Override public packages: If you want to use a modified version of a 3rd-party package, you can publish your version locally under the same name.

## Features

- Private npm proxy registry: Verdaccio acts as a private npm registry, allowing you to publish and access private packages.
- Local network proxy: Verdaccio can act as a proxy for other registries, such as npmjs.org, and cache downloaded modules to decrease latency and provide failover.
- Pluggable application: Verdaccio supports various community-made plugins to extend its storage capabilities, such as integrating with Amazon's S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
- Easy to install and use: Verdaccio comes with its own tiny database and requires no configuration to get started. It is compatible with popular npm clients like npm, yarn, and pnpm.
- Docker and Kubernetes support: Verdaccio provides an official Docker image and supports deployment using Kubernetes Helm for easy DevOps integration.
