1-Click installation template for Paperless-ngx on Easypanel

## Description

Paperless-ngx is a document management system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive. It allows you to organize and index your scanned documents with tags, correspondents, types, and more. It performs OCR on your documents, adds selectable text to image-only documents, and supports various file formats including PDF, images, plain text files, and Office documents. The app stores your documents plain on disk and provides a single-page application front end with a dashboard for basic statistics and document upload. It also offers full-text search, auto-completion, highlighting, and searching for similar documents. Paperless-ngx supports email processing, machine learning-powered document matching, and is optimized for multi-core systems. The app can be deployed using docker-compose or by manually installing the dependencies and setting up Apache and a database server. Paperless-ngx is available in multiple languages and welcomes contributions from the community. However, it should be run on a trusted host due to the lack of encryption for stored information.
