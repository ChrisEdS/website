# CubeJS

1-Click installation template for CubeJS on Easypanel

## Description

Cube is an embedded analytics app that provides a semantic layer for every data app. It allows data engineers and developers to make their data consistent, secure, performant, and accessible across every application. Cube&#39;s semantic layer acts as a middleware between data sources and data applications, enabling users to define and manage metrics, grant access control, ensure data caching, and connect data to any front-end application through APIs. With Cube, users can unify their organization&#39;s knowledge base, improve application performance, reduce development time, and create beautiful, data-rich user experiences.

## Benefits

- Consistent Metrics: Cube enables users to define and manage metrics upstream, creating a centralized, single source of truth with consistent metrics that only need to be defined once.
- Secure Access Control: Cube's semantic layer coordinates access control upstream of data applications, ensuring that only authorized users have access to the right metrics.
- Reliable Performance: Cube's caching layer and advanced preaggregation capabilities ensure that data is reliably performant, providing low-latency access to the latest information.
- Flexible Integration: Cube's APIs (GraphQL, REST, and SQL) allow users to connect their data to any front-end application, enabling the creation of custom visualizations and integration with data visualization tools and business intelligence dashboards.

## Features

- Data Modeling: Cube's data modeling feature allows users to define and manage metrics upstream, consolidating their workflow, centralizing definitions, and creating a single source of truth.
- Access Control: Cube's access control feature enables users to grant column- and role-based operational and viewing permissions upstream, ensuring granular access controls.
- Caching: Cube's caching feature ensures reliable data performance with a powerful caching layer and advanced preaggregation capabilities.
- APIs: Cube's APIs (GraphQL, REST, and SQL) allow users to connect their data to any front-end application, building beautiful custom visualizations and integrating with data visualization tools and business intelligence dashboards.
