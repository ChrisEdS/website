# Hosting a Laravel Application with Easypanel

Laravel is a popular web application framework built with PHP, which provides an excellent structure for developing robust and scalable web applications. Easypanel is a web hosting control panel that simplifies web hosting management, automating several tasks, including server creation, application deployment, and configuration management.

In this guide, we aim to provide a detailed step-by-step approach to deploying a Laravel application on Easypanel. After following the steps below, you will have a Laravel application running and accessible via a publicly accessible URL.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Laravel application running smoothly on your local machine.
- Easypanel running on your server.

## Step 2: Set up Your Application Service

Once you have obtained your new project, the next step is to set up your application service. The application service represents your Laravel application, and you can set it up quickly by following the steps below:

1. Within the project dashboard, click on "+ Service"
2. Select "App" and specify the service's name and domain. You can leave the domain blank and easypanel will generate a subdomain for you.

## Step 3: Set git / GitHub source

If you plan to deploy your Laravel application from a repository, you must set up the Git repository source. Easypanel supports Git and GitHub to facilitate your automation process.

If you are using a private repository we suggest following the [Git SSH tutorial](/docs/code-sources/git-ssh)

## Step 4: Select Your Build Method

Easypanel allows you to deploy your Laravel application using two methods:

- Nixpacks: This is a package manager that simplifies building web applications for PHP developers. You can use Nixpacks to define the environment for your Laravel application and build it automatically.
- Dockerfile: Docker is a containerization technology that allows you to package your Laravel application with all its dependencies and deploy it as a container. You can use Dockerfile to define the environment for your Laravel application and build it automatically.

Follow the steps below to select your build method:

1. Navigate to the "Build" tab within your application service.
2. Choose either Nixpacks or Dockerfile and configure it according to your preferences and needs.
3. Save the changes, and a prompt will appear with the option to "Deploy."
4. Click on "Deploy" to initiate your deployment process.

## Step 5: Set up Your Environment

Every Laravel application has an .env file that contains all the environment variables required for smooth operation. Use the "Environment" tab to set up your environment variables. Follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the "Environment" tab within your application service.
2. Set your environment variables by specifying the key-value pairs as desired.
3. Save the changes to complete the process.
4. Press "Deploy" to apply the changes in your running app.
