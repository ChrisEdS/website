# Deploy a Next JS app

This guide outlines the steps you need to follow to deploy a Next JS app on Easypanel.

## Steps

1. Create a new project (or select an existing one)

2. Create a new app service

   The **name** of the service is arbitrary. The **domain name** is where your app will live.

3. Connect your Github repository

   You can do this in the **Source** panel from the **General** tab.

4. Set your environment variables

   If your app doesn't have any variables, you can skip this step.

5. Click the **Deploy** button
