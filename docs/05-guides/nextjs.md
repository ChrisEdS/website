This guide outlines the steps you need to follow to deploy a Next JS app on Easypanel.

## Setup Project

You can create a new project or use an existing one. Projects are a simple way to group your services.

## Setup App Service

1. Create a new **App** service

   The **name** of the service is arbitrary. The **domain name** is where your app will live.

2. Connect Github repository

   You can do this in the **Source** panel from the **General** tab.

3. Setup environment variables

   If your app doesn't have any variables, you can skip this step.

4. Click the **Deploy** button
