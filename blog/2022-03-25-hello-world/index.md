- what is Easypanel
- my story
  - name, family, location
  - product => services => consulting => product
  - a lot of failed attempts
- why I built Easypanel
    - cpanel is old (php oriented)
        - easypanel is modern
    - docker is hard (if done manualy)
        - easypanel is easy
    - hosted solutions are expensive
        - easypanel is self-hosted
- the name Easypanel
    - core value, cliche, but important for me
    - cpanel
